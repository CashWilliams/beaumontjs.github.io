#speaker notes

- welcome (**slide 1**)
  - i’m Joah, this is my fiancee Haley, we have worked together to organize this meetup
  - i work at capital one, they’re sponsoring as an attempt to get more active in the local tech community
  - our other sponsor is armorshred — they’re a really cool local shredding company, so if you or your company has any bulk shredding needs, you know who to call
  - this month, since it’s our first meetup, and i’m still figuring out how we’re going to do this, i have a really short presentation to give.
- what bmtjs isn’t (**slide 2**)
  - i want to talk about what bmtjs isn’t.
  - in short, this meetup is not a place for you to harass people. really, you shouldn’t do that anywhere, but since i’m leading this, that’s the rule i’m setting.
  - we’re adhering to the jsconf code of conduct. you can read more at that url
- what bmtjs is (**slides 3-11**) 
  - now, more optimistically, i want to talk about what bmtjs is.
  - bmtjs is an opportunity to meet like-minded individuals (**slide 3**). i’d love to see (even) more diversity as we grow, but, ya know, we’re all going to be STANDARD NERDS (**slide 4**)
  - bmtjs is an opportunity to foster community growth   (**slide 5**)
    - we all live in this area. i’m sure you all know that beaumont isn’t very “forward thinking”, and there isn’t really a thriving community for web development. i’d like to fix that. and we an do that together
  - bmtjs is an opportunity to destress (**slide 6**)
    - you all know, we all get stressed out with work projects, and we all come to the point at times where we decide that programming sucks (**slide 7**). 
    - we all get to the point where we wonder if there is anything better to be doing with our lives than monotonously typing characters into a text editor
    - i want to make this time an opportunity to destress (**slide 8**), and focus on making programming fun again.
  - bmtjs is an opportunity to share knowledge (**slide 9**)
    - i want share what knowledge i have, and i want to learn from you guys — please, i want to hear about your latest projects and studies — that’s what’s this time is for.
  - stemming from that, i want bmtjs to provide leadership opportunities (**slide 10**)
    - i’ll be honest, the reason i started planning bmtjs was to be able to practice giving technical talks in front of people. it’s something i’ve never done before, and i want to practice and eventually be able to give a talk at a conference. so, i was like, you know what, i may as well give it a go. (**slide 11**)
    - that is open to all of you, as well, though. and i would really like to not be needing to give _all_ the talks — again, I want to hear from you guys. I want to learn from you.
- meetup structure (**slide 12**)
	- the meetup structure, following this month _should_ look like this:
		- 1-2 short talks
			- these are going to be the technical talks from me or you guys, they can be about anything inside the realm of web development that you’re interested in or passionate about
		- a “passion” talk
			- this was suggested to me by a friend that leads a meetup in new york — the passion talk can be about anything you’re passion about. that can be about anything from glass making or yak herding
		- the most important time of the meetup, imo, is the discussion time afterwards. that’ll simply be a time to connect, network, and learn from each other. i look forward to meeting each of you personally in that time
- </talk> (**slide 13**)
	- that’s all i’ve got :) thanks for listening to me
	- does anyone have any questions?
